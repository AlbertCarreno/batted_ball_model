# Batted Ball Outcome Model

**Goal :** Build a robust and accurate model for correctly predicting batted ball outcomes based on variables like exit velocity, launch angle, and point of contact.
**Skills/Tools :** R | keras | tidyverse | xgboost | randomforest 

## Results
Built a majority vote ensemble learning model that corectly classified 88.3% of batted ball outcomes(single, double, triple, home run, out) correctly.
